Tutorials

1. How to use BioKEEN

Application Scenarios
---------------------
There are several tasks that can be completed with biological knowledge graph embeddings.
This section links notebooks that show several of those scenarios.

Link Prediction
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
1. Case Scenario applied to the ComPath dataset.
2. Case Scenario applied to the ADEPTUS dataset.
3. Case Scenario applied to the HSDN dataset.
4. Case Scenario applied to union of the HSDN and ADEPTUS dataset.

Entity Disambiguation
---------------------
This is the task of identifying when several nodes from different KGs that have been
merged refer to the same entity. We haven't got a use case for this yet.

Link-Based Clustering
---------------------
This is the task of clustering nodes based on their embeddings. We haven't got a use
case for this yet.
